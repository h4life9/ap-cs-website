      </a></p>
    <p>My app is to educate children about the different species that live in the forest. While also teaching them
      about
      the harm of trash in the environment. In this video, you can see a start screen prompting the user to click
      play.
      Once you are in the play menu telling you about the biome, which is a forest, saying that not everything in the
      forest is meant to be touched. After creation is clicked, you are brought into the main game. There are various
      plants and objects scattered around the map. On the top left of the game there is a menu that displays the
      different objects that are able to be clicked on the map. The value of these objects are set to zero. When you
      click on one of these items the variable that is set in the menu is increased by one. The input is when the item
      is clicked, and the output is that variable that was displayed before increased by 1.

    <p>This game was made inspired by a project titled the same way. The object of the game is to draw a maze. Then
      after drawing be able to go make your way to the end. The catch is you are not able to go over walls. The only
      way
      is to go around them. Click the link above to play!
